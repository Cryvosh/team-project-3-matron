## Iteration 03 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: Thursday March 5, at 5:00pm
 * Where: Robarts Group Study Room 3

## Process - Reflection


#### Q1. Decisions that turned out well

List **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.


 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why (i.e. give a supporting argument) you consider a decision to be successful.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).

The first successful decision we made was adopting [GitHub projects](https://github.com/csc301-winter-2020/team-project-3-matron/projects/1) as a mixed kanban/scrum style project management board. The rich integration with other GitHub features such as issues, commits, branches, and pull requests, all of which we made heavy use of, helped it to organize the project extremely well. The projects feature naturally worked as a Kanban board with different columns, cards for each task that also double as issues, and automatic card movement when pull requests are merged or issues are created. It also has a feature called milestones which helped us to organize our work into scrum-style weekly sprints and completion tracking. Overall, GitHub helped to keep us organized and on track.

The second successful decision was splitting up the different areas of the project into different roles that each team member was in charge of. This allowed development to happen in parallel which sped up the iteration process and allowed each of us to focus more closely on a specific part of the project to give it more polish. Also, having team members dedicated to areas such as testing and DevOps helped to create a much more more polished product with quicker deployment, so that the rest of the team only needed to worry about their own tasks.

Finally, using Discord for internal communication was also a good decision because it facilitated internal communication and increased organization in the team. Having multiple channels allowed important annoucements to quickly reach the entire team such as team meetings or any changes. We also had separate channels for different areas of the project such as the front end or the backend, which helped multiple subteams collaborate in parallel without disturbing the others. Also, since a team of 8 members isn't actually very large overall, we had most of our discussion in a group channel which meant that most of the team was up to date on the state of the project at any given team. This let us work at quite a fast face near the end of the deliverable when we were squashing bugs that needed input from people on many different subteams, and overall let the project be developed faster.

#### Q2. Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

List **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.

 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why (i.e. give a supporting argument) you consider a decision to be unsuccessful
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).


#### Q3. Planned changes

List any **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why you are making a change.


## Product - Review

#### Q4. How was your product demo?
 * How did you prepare your demo?
 * What did you manage to demo to your partner?
 * Did your partner accept the features?
 * Were there change requests?
 * What did you learn from the demo from either a process or product perspective?
 * *This section will be marked very leniently so keep it brief and just make sure the points are addressed*
